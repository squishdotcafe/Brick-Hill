# Brick Hill Source 2023
This is the Brick Hill source from 2023, it should be common sense to setup.

If you use this according to the LICENCE you must open source any updates you make to it.

This source is more tailored towards my own needs, I would instead recommend you use the version release by spacebuilder himself.

# If you don't know Laravel

All the frontend of the site is found in ```/resources/views/```

All the backend of the site is found in ```/app/Http```
